|	You got 30 life points. If an enemy reaches the end it will be reduced for 1.			       |
|	If you kill an enemy you get money. Each enemy gives you a different amount of money.	   |
|	You can kill enemies with towers you build on building spots marked grey.				         |
|	There are four different towers which have different stats like price,					         |
|	damage, reload time, range and one with a slow down modifier.							               |
|																							                                             |
|	Every level has 10 waves where every wave changes the enemy life, speed and reward.		   |
|																							                                             |
